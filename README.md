# Meteorio

A simple weather app with React.js: this is a React.js remake of my earlier vanilla JS web app [Meteorio](https://github.com/NimaBavari/Meteorio "Meteorio").

**Time spent: 3 work hours.**

**Note:** This app has been made as a start of my React.js practice.

## ISSUES

The following issues need to be addressed and resolved:

* [ ] Potentially incorrect conditional order of components in `src/App.jsx`
* [ ] Potential bug in fetch promise chain in `src/components/Form.jsx` (delayed response)
* [ ] Need to convert to global states
